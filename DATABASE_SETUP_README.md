## üîß Configuration

### Firebase Configuration

Make sure your Firebase configuration is set up correctly in `assets/js/firebase-config.js`:

```javascript

  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789",
  appId: "your-app-id-here"
};
```

### Firestore Security Rules

The database setup includes comprehensive security rules. Make sure to deploy them to your Firebase project:

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize Firebase in your project
firebase init firestore

# Deploy security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## üìã Sample Data Included

## üö® Important Notes

### Before Running Setup

1. **Backup Existing Data**: If you have existing data, back it up first
2. **Firebase Project**: Ensure your Firebase project is properly configured
3. **Authentication**: Make sure Firebase Authentication is enabled
4. **Firestore**: Ensure Firestore is enabled in your Firebase project

### After Setup

1. **Verify Data**: Check that all collections were created successfully
2. **Test Authentication**: Try logging in with the created users
3. **Check Permissions**: Verify that role-based access is working
4. **School Pay**: Configure School Pay Uganda integration if needed

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Firebase Configuration Error**
   - Check your Firebase config in `firebase-config.js`
   - Ensure all required fields are filled

2. **Permission Denied**
   - Check Firestore security rules
   - Ensure your Firebase project has the correct permissions

3. **Network Errors**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify Firebase project is accessible

4. **Batch Size Errors**
   - Firestore has a limit of 500 operations per batch
   - The setup script handles this automatically

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for error messages in the browser console
2. **Firebase Console**: Check your Firebase project console for errors
3. **Network Tab**: Check for failed network requests
4. **Firestore Rules**: Ensure security rules are properly deployed

## üìö Next Steps

After successful database setup:

1. **Configure School Pay**: Set up School Pay Uganda integration
2. **Add Real Data**: Replace sample data with real school data
3. **User Training**: Train staff on using the system
4. **Backup Strategy**: Implement regular database backups
5. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and alerts

## üéØ Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for sensitive data
2. **Security Rules**: Review and customize security rules
3. **Backup Strategy**: Implement automated backups
4. **Monitoring**: Set up Firebase monitoring and alerts
5. **Performance**: Optimize queries and indexes
